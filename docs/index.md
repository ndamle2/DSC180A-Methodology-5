# Questions

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we've covered so far is the concept of congestion and the scale at which chip design operates. The combination of extremely small and precise wires and gates, but the massive amount of them within a single product presents a challenging problem with many different avenues that can be taken. More specifically, I find the fact that optimizing for chip design involves balancing so many different priorities and variables extremely interesting.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
In Quarter 2, my group and I are still considering many different options, ranging from building off of the paper we recreated in Q1 to exploring a completely different aspect of chip design. One idea I'm interested in is exploring how changing the representation of a chip graph, from directed to bipartite and so on, will affect machine learning performed on the data. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A change I'd make with the current Q1 Project of recreating the paper is to incoporate new datasets. One think that has stood out to me is the diversity of different chip datasets, so incporating those could be helpful in exploring new techniques.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
One other technique I'd be interested in experimenting with is generative AI. While chip design as a domain is far too complex for current generative AI tools to truly "understand" and impact - I think working with generative AI may allow us to find newer ways to approach the problem.
