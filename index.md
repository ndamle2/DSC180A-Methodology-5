# Questions

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we've covered so far is the concept of congestion and the scale at which chip design operates. The combination of extremely small and precise wires and gates, but the massive amount of them within a single product presents a challenging problem with many different avenues that can be taken. More specifically, I find the fact that optimizing for chip design involves balancing so many different priorities and variables extremely interesting.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
In Quarter 2, my group and I are still considering many different options, ranging from building off of the paper we recreated in Q1 to exploring a completely different aspect of chip design. One idea I'm interested in is exploring how changing the representation of a chip graph, from directed to bipartite and so on, will affect machine learning performed on the data. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
